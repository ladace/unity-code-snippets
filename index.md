# How To Use

**To use these scripts, you must create a script that has the same name as the class name (which is the word after `class` word.**

For example,

```csharp
public class MyClassName : MonoBehaviour {
    void Start () {
        Debug.Log("Hello, world");
    }
}
```

You have to create a file called `MyClassName`, otherwise you can change the word after `class` to the name of the file.

**The file name must be the same as the class name.**
